# ✅ Summer Income Now Included!

## What Was Fixed

**Before:** Summer income (`hoursSummer`) was completely ignored. The calculator only showed Fall and Spring semesters, both using school hours.

**After:** Summer periods are now properly included with higher work hours, showing the full financial picture.

## How It Works Now

### Timeline Structure (6 Semesters Example):

```
Fall 2026    → Spring 2027 → Summer 2027 →
Fall 2027    → Spring 2028 → Summer 2028 →
Fall 2028    → Spring 2029 → (No summer - graduation!)
```

### Calculation Per Period:

#### Fall/Spring Semesters:
```
Income:
- Work: school hours/week × 4 weeks × 4 months × rate
- Financial Aid: scholarship + bursary + grant
- Savings: total savings ÷ number of periods

Expenses:
- Academic: tuition + books + supplies (per semester)
- Living: monthly costs × 4 months
```

#### Summer Periods:
```
Income:
- Work: SUMMER hours/week × 4 weeks × 4 months × rate ✅
- Savings: total savings ÷ number of periods
- NO financial aid (typically not available in summer)

Expenses:
- Living: monthly costs × 4 months
- NO academic costs (no tuition in summer)
```

## Example Calculation

### Student Profile:
- 6 semesters
- Works **15 hrs/week during school** @ $15/hr
- Works **40 hrs/week during summer** @ $15/hr
- $2,000 scholarship/semester
- $1,050/month living costs
- $5,600 academic costs/semester

### Year 1 Breakdown:

**Fall 2026:**
- Work income: 15 hrs × 4 weeks × 4 months × $15 = **$3,600**
- Aid: $2,000
- Academic costs: $5,600
- Living costs: $4,200
- **Net: -$4,200**
- Cumulative balance: **-$4,200**

**Spring 2027:**
- Work income: 15 hrs × 4 weeks × 4 months × $15 = **$3,600**
- Aid: $2,000
- Academic costs: $5,600
- Living costs: $4,200
- **Net: -$4,200**
- Cumulative balance: **-$8,400**

**Summer 2027:** ✅ NEW!
- Work income: **40 hrs** × 4 weeks × 4 months × $15 = **$9,600** 🎯
- Aid: $0 (no aid in summer)
- Academic costs: $0 (no tuition in summer)
- Living costs: $4,200
- **Net: +$5,400** (SURPLUS!)
- Cumulative balance: **-$3,000**

### Impact:

**Without summer:** Balance after Spring 2027 = -$8,400
**With summer:** Balance after Summer 2027 = -$3,000

**Summer recovery:** +$5,400! ✅

## Chart Display

The chart now shows:

```
Fall 2026    → -$4,200
Spring 2027  → -$8,400 (worst point)
Summer 2027  → -$3,000 (recovery!)
Fall 2027    → -$7,200
Spring 2028  → -$11,400
Summer 2028  → -$6,000 (recovery!)
Fall 2028    → -$10,200
Spring 2029  → -$14,400 (graduation)
```

**Visual pattern:**
- Line drops during Fall/Spring (paying tuition)
- Line rises during Summer (working more hours, no tuition)
- Shows realistic "sawtooth" pattern of student finances

---

## Key Points

✅ **Summer hours are HIGHER** - Students typically work full-time (40 hrs/week)
✅ **No tuition in summer** - Only living expenses
✅ **No financial aid in summer** - Most aid is semester-based
✅ **Helps offset deficits** - Summer earnings help pay for next semester

---

## Savings Distribution

Savings are now distributed across ALL periods (including summer):

**Example with $6,000 savings and 6 semesters:**
- Total periods: 6 semesters + 2 summers = 8 periods
- Savings per period: $6,000 ÷ 8 = **$750/period**

Each Fall, Spring, AND Summer gets $750 from savings.

---

## Summary

The calculator now accurately shows:

1. **Fall semesters** - High expenses (tuition), lower income (school hours)
2. **Spring semesters** - High expenses (tuition), lower income (school hours)
3. **Summer periods** - Low expenses (no tuition), HIGH income (summer hours) ✅

Students can see how summer work helps offset their debt and plan accordingly!

**Summer income is now fully integrated!** 🎓☀️💰
