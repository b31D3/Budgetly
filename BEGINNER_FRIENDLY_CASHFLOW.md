## How It Works

### Step 1: Calculate Monthly Expenses
```
Academic Costs (spread monthly):
- Tuition + Books + Supplies (annual amount ÷ 12)

Living Costs (already monthly):
- Rent + Utilities + Groceries + Cell Phone + Transportation + Memberships

TOTAL MONTHLY EXPENSES = Academic Costs/month + Living Costs
```

### Step 2: Calculate Monthly Income
```
Work Income (varies by month):
- School months (Jan-Apr, Sep-Dec): School hours × 4 weeks × hourly rate
- Summer months (May-Aug): Summer hours × 4 weeks × hourly rate

Financial Aid (spread monthly):
- (Scholarship + Bursary + Grant) per semester × 2 semesters ÷ 12 months

Savings (spread monthly):
- Total savings ÷ total months

TOTAL MONTHLY INCOME = Work + Aid/month + Savings/month
```

### Step 3: Calculate Net Monthly Cashflow
```
NET MONTHLY CASHFLOW = Monthly Income - Monthly Expenses
```

### Step 4: Track Cumulative Balance
```
Each month:
  Cumulative Balance = Previous Balance + Net Monthly Cashflow
```
